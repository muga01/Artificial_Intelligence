This repo presents different tasks related to AI. These tasks include searching algorithms (BFS,DFS and Ant Colony Optimization) to solve the Travelling Salesman Problem, A Particle Swarm Optimization algorithm to minimize the selected function. In addition, I present neural network and convolutional neural networks for image classification problems, designing the autoencoder using CNN, finding patterns in strings and many more.

## BFS,DFS,ACO
See the files BFS,DFS and ACO for the codes to solve the problem based on the instructions below:-

1. Create a set of cities (as points) with coordinates x, y on a plane with height as z coordinate. The cost of going from city A to city B is equal to the Euclidean distance between two cities, if there exists a road. You should define scenarios according to two criteria:  

    a) There are all the direct connections / c.a. 80% of possible connections 

    b) The problem is symmetrical / asymmetrical (in asymmetrical â€“ going up is height +10%, going down: -10%) 

2. You should choose the coordinates randomly from the range <-100, 100> for x,y and <0, 50> for z. 

3. Represent the created map as a weighted (directed) graph, where cities are the nodes and roads are the edges of the graph. 
In the created scene, solve the traveling salesman problem: The salesman starts from a chosen city and has to visit every city exactly once before returning to the starting city. The goal is to find a path with the lowest cost.

You may want to clone the project or download the individual files locally whatever suits you. Incase of datasets, in here I don't upload them, they should be easily downloadable from the internet as they are standard datasets.

# Artificial_Intelligence
This repo presents different tasks related to AI. These tasks include searching algorithms (BFS,DFS and Ant Colony Optimization) to solve the Travelling Salesman Problem, A Particle Swarm Optimization algorithm to minimize the selected function. In addition, I present neural network and convolutional neural networks for image classification problems, designing the autoencoder using CNN, finding patterns in strings and many more.

### Disclaimer
You may want to clone the project or download the individual files locally whatever suits you. Incase of datasets, in here I don't upload them, they should be easily downloadable from the internet as they are standard datasets.
